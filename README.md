# TCOB_ELO_Tracker

Just a simple bundle of files that track and post the ELO and other stats for the TCOB Destiny clan. 

To prevent headaches and make data aquisition easier, I added printClanInfo.py. This will allow quick retrieval and printing of key bits of information like member IDs, character IDs, etc. It can also serve as a testing area for functions as they are added. 

The project is now a functional proof of concept. There are still issues to work through, and smaller changes to make.
